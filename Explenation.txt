My plan for the wireframe is there will be a menu for the side. It has 6 options:
Options, search, mail, adding income (i am using arrow up for now as the same with
adding expnences),  adding expenses, and your profile for updating personal
details. Then it also shows your current balance, income, and expences, it focus largely
on the balance so the person knows how much money they have left. And lastly we
have a chart for Income and expenses in order and is filtered by month. And in
the last box will show you the latest expenses.
